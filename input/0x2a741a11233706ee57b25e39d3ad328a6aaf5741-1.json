    "storeDescription": "Steven Baltay has returned! You may remember Steven from Drop 8 back in June. He released one of the most hyped Nifties ever on Nifty Gateway in 'Take Another Look'. Steven Baltay is a 3D artist and animator based in Brooklyn, NY. His work revolves around surreal representations of organic forms that evoke surprise, disgust, and satisfaction. He has worked with several well known artists and brands including Adobe, Beck, Bershka, Converse, Herno, Volvox Labs (Netflix), and Rose Pilkington (Ports 1961)",
    "storeDescription2": "One of Nifty Gateway's favorite NFT artists, Steven Baltay is back with another iconic collection. We find ourselves in constant astonishment at Baltay's ability to take a familiar subject matter and deconstructing it in such a way that makes us question why it ever was its original form when Baltay's vision is way more fun.",
