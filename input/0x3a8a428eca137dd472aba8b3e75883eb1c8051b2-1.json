    "storeDescription": "London-based artist and director Ondrej Zunka began experimenting with design and digital art out of disillusion with the Master of Economy and System Engineering degree he graduated with. After working with various award winning design studios around the world and acclaiming a reputable status in the commercial design world, he's now running his own design practice and has worked on projects for brands including Nike, Prada, Adidas, Puma, Apple, Burberry, MTV and collaborated with Hypebeast and Highsnobiety. \\n About The Series \\n Living in London amidst lockdown and the typical crappy British winter, Ondrej escaped into creating a collection of artworks titled \"I'D RATHER BE OUTSIDE\" - a series of 6 speculative realities celebrating flora, fauna and attempts on finding optimism to face the future ahead.",
    "storeDescription2": "In his debut collection on NG, Ondrej captures a feeling we all can related too- a desire to get outside.  His whimsical interpretations of nature are a pleasure to look at, and we're glad that we get to showcase the collection on NG and welcome him into the NFT space.  Ondrej is a man of many talents and interests, and we look forward to seeing what he does next!",
