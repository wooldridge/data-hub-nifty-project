    "storeDescription": "Nick van Hofwegen aka YOUNG & SICK has created art and music his whole life. His work can be found on instagram @youngandsick. http://instagram.com/youngandsick   This will be his first NFT drop, but definitely not his last, as he is creating weird art non-stop. In this drop he wanted to focus on some crypto favorites, as well as create an introduction to his own art.  He has made art for some incredible musicians and festivals, including: Machine Gun Kelly, Young Thug, Foster the People, Maroon 5, Austin City Limits, BUKU, Camp Nowhere, M3F, and many more.   As a musician he has released music with B3SCI, Harvest/Capitol, Island UK, PMR, and Neon Gold.  His most recent album Demo Club can be found here: https://spoti.fi/3bsPEod  NYLON had some nice things to say about his project: https://www.nylon.com/articles/young-and-sick-interview-2017 \\n  HARD TO EXPLAIN is a mess of my trippy characters and nods to the crypto community, that will take me years to explain to my parents. Thanks for tuning in and dropping out.",
    "storeDescription2": "We were in love with Nick aka Young & Sick's art since before we even knew Nick's name! As fans of music by Foster the People, Maroon 5 and many others, we've been admirers of the cover art that Nick in fact created. On top of being a talented artist, Nick is also an incredible musician and animator, so we couldn't be happier to share Nick's first Nifty Gateway collection that Nick created the art, animation and music for!",
