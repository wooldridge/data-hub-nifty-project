    "storeDescription": "Killer Acid was originally created by artist R. Corradetti in 2010. Located in Santa Cruz, CA, the brand specializes in screen prints, T-shirts, and a myriad of mysterious, humorous, and highly-detailed psychedelic ephemera. The style is a blend of head shop and punk rock, hearkening back to the artist’s tumultuous and technicolor coming-of-age in New York City. Corradetti’s cartoon psychedelia drips with his signature tongue-in-cheek humor. Random, bright, and bizarre, the work draws the viewer in. Upon closer inspection, though, one finds the headscapes and doodles are interwoven with personal meanings and artifacts of memories. Entering a burgeoning crypto art community in 2018, Killer Acid NFTs were the first minted on the Superrare test net. ‘I’m Not As Think As You Stoned I Am’ is their first release with Nifty Gateway.",
