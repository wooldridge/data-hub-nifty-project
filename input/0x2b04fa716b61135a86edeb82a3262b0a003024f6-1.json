    "storeDescription": "Olive Allen (OA) is a New York-based visual artist working at the intersection of art and technology. Her art, sardonic in nature, explores current cultural shifts through deeply personal experience. Olive is one of the early adopters and founders in the blockchain space. She got her first Bitcoin in 2013 and became actively involved in the community, whose idealistic ideas of transparency, individual privacy, and economic freedom she still shares. Olive's collection, HYPEBIRDS, is a pack collection featuring 6 of the HYPEBIRDs and 195 'Pieces of Something'. What are Pieces of Something? Each of the 195 pieces is a square tile that makes up one larger artwork as a whole. Piece #196 will be auctioned off as the final piece. Whoever wins the auction will have a choose between receiving the original Piece of Something painting, or a 1 of 1 Golden Furby Nifty!  The 196 pieces are part of a fractional ownership painting - cutting it into pieces. Each tile is like owning a share of the painting. To fully own the painting (will be backed by a physical work) a collector will need all the pieces. Piece of something #196 is the final and the key piece of the painting. If The winner of the auction picks the Golden Bird the painting will be missing one piece forever. So a collector will decide the fate of artwork and its final look.",
    "storeDescription2": "We love Olive's ability to innovate and to stretch the boundaries of what is possible in a pack collection with her HYPEBIRDs collection. We have never tried a format like HYPEBIRDs before in a pack collection and we are thrilled that Olive is the first to try it. She understands how the NFT space works, is constantly innovating, and we cannot wait to see what she accomplishes in the future.",
