    "storeDescription": "About Steve Aoki \\n Counting nearly 3 billion music streams to his name, Steve Aoki is a true visionary. Billboard described the 2x-GRAMMY-Nominated artist/DJ/producer and Dim Mak Records founder as “one of the most in-demand entertainers in the world.” As a solo artist, Aoki boasts a lauded cross-genre discography that includes 7 studio albums and collaborations with Lil Uzi Vert, Maluma, BTS, Linkin Park and Louis Tomlinson amongst others. \\n In 1996, he established Dim Mak out of his college dorm room, a trendsetting record label, events/lifestyle company and apparel brand. It has served as a launch pad for global acts like The Chainsmokers, Bloc Party, The Bloody Beetroots, and The Kills, in addition to being the home of early releases from acts such as ZEDD and Diplo. As a nightlife impresario, Aoki’s legendary Hollywood club night Dim Mak Tuesdays hosted early performances from future superstars such as Kid Cudi, Daft Punk, Lady Gaga, and Travis Scott. \\n A true renaissance man, Steve Aoki is also a fashion designer, author and entrepreneur. In 2012, he founded THE AOKI FOUNDATION, which primarily supports organizations in the field of brain science research with a specific focus on regenerative medicine and brain preservation. In addition, Aoki has pushed his clothing line Dim Mak Collection to new heights, both with original designs and collaborations with everyone from A Bathing Ape to the Bruce Lee estate. Aoki’s multi-faceted journey is chronicled through the Grammy-nominated Netflix documentary I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead (2016) and his memoir BLUE: The Color of Noise(2019). In the summer of 2020, Aoki unveiled his Latin music imprint, Dim Mak En Fuego, continuing to break down musical and cultural boundaries ‘by any means necessary.' \\n About Antoni Tudisco \\n \r\nCreative director & 3D visual artist Antoni Tudisco was born & raised in Hamburg, Germany where he grew up studying media management and web design & development programming. Tudisco, a fashion enthusiast, has worked with top-tier brands Nike, Adidas, Versace & Puma and has gone on to launch his own brand TUDISCO STUDIO as well. Having been featured in Vogue, Highsnobiety & Hypebeast and winning several notable design awards, Tudisco with his surreal and colorful style is an emerging talent who has garnered the attention of artists like Will Smith, Pop Smoke & Swae Lee commissioning work with him.\r\n\\n\r\nPlease note - open editions minted prior to the drop are reserved for the artist.",
