    "storeDescription": "The story begins, where another has ended. A masked figure, bound to the monotonous, abysmal rituals for a life that was never demanded, if asked for at all. A representation of us all. They represent the life of an upbringing damned by the intricacies of morale and beliefs that a knowledge driven life feels pertinent. But where it is, there is life and there is light. There is pain, and there is darkness. We see ourselves in them and they in us. Our tragedy is their story. Their story is ours to tell. They are us, we are them and we are one. Godz is an idea conveyed through music and expressions. Through an identity that anyone could see themselves in. Who are we? What are we? When are we? Why are we? Some beg to ask the question, does it even matter?",
