In 2015, Filip started a daily render project that lasted for almost 400 days and helped him gain initial traction online. Since then, he has grown to one of the most-followed 3D artists in the world, amassing almost 700k fans across his socials, which opened the door to collaborations with many international brands such as Adidas, Coca Cola, Samsung, or artists like Jean-Michel Jarre.  In his work, Filip balances on the edge between reality and fiction with elaborate, detailed renderings. He is most known for this collection of artworks series titled 'Pop Culture Dystopia', which envisions decaying pop-culture icons in desolate and abandoned post-apocalyptic landscapes.",
    "storeDescription2": "We first saw Filip's work when he was recommended to us by Slimesunday. We were instantly captivated by his renderings and fell in love with his dystopian themes and cartoon fossils. Filip just collaborated with OG Esports for our first gaming collaboration, and we're happy to follow that collection with his own personal release!",
