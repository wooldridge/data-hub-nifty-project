    "storeDescription": "Dave Whyte is an artist and motion graphic designer, and former physicist, from Dublin, Ireland. His medium is short looping geometric animations. On his collection, Dave wrote, 'Three looping animations, all based on hexagons, but through very different techniques and approaches. The techniques are ones I have explored frequently in my recent work.'",
    "storeDescription2": "Dave's GIFs are absolutely mesmerizing. Their seamless loops and optical illusion like animations can have you staring for hours. Most of his clips are only a few seconds long, but because of his expertise with looping the animations, they endlessly loop perfectly. We are thrilled that he will be releasing his first ever tokenized work on Nifty Gateway!",
