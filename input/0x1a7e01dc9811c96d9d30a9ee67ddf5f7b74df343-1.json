    "storeDescription": "Slimesunday is a digital collage artist based out of Boston MA. He consistently pushes the limits of what is acceptable in mainstream media, exploring bizarre and erotic topics. His primary portfolio is displayed on Instagram where he has generated over 520K followers. Slimesunday’s art can be found in Playboy, Penthouse, Hunger, Plastik, and Glamour Magazine. Slimesunday is the visual artist behind the audio visual duo SSX3LAU, who has had previous success on Nifty Gateway.",
    "storeDescription2": "Slimesunday features some of the most provocative yet brilliant artwork in the world. It is no surprise that he has had several works censored by Instagram for this reason. While true, it is the exact reason why we love Slimesunday's work so much - it invokes a 'wow' response and instantly catches the viewers eye. It is certainly true with his NG collection as well and we are thrilled to host him! We also love his role in the collaboration between himself and SSX3LAU - they crushed it in their debut NG collection.",
